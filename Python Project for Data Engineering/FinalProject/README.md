# Python Project for Data Engineering: Project Overview


I have assumed the role of data engineer working for an international financial analysis company. My company tracks stock prices, commodities, forex rates, inflation rates.  My job is to extract financial data from various sources like websites, APIs and files provided by various financial analysis firms. After I have collected the data, I extract the data of interest to your company and transform it based on the requirements given to you. Once the transformation is complete I load that data into a database.


In this project I have:

* Collected data using APIs
* Collected data using webscraping.
* Downloaded files to process.    
* Read csv, xml and json file types.
* Extracted data from the above file types.
* Transformed data.
* Used the built in logging module.
* Saved the transformed data in a ready-to-load format which data engineers can use to load the data.
